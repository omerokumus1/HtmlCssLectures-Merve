    <p>A quote from another website:</p>
    <blockquote
      cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle"
    >
      In the field of software engineering, the interface segregation principle
      (ISP) states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does
      not use.[1] ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and
      more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the
      methods that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also
      called role interfaces.[2]
